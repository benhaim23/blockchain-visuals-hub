# 14. L2s and the Rise of Modular Blockchains

Ethereum can only process so many transactions. As demand grew, so did fees—sometimes reaching hundreds of dollars per transaction.

Layer 2 solutions and modular blockchains are the crypto ecosystem's response to this scaling challenge.

In this article, we'll explore how these systems work, why they matter for analysts, and how to track metrics across a multi-chain universe.

## 🧠 Understanding the Modular Blockchain Stack

Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are "monolithic"—each chain handles all four layers of functionality:

1. **Execution**: Processing transactions
2. **Settlement**: Finalizing transaction state
3. **Consensus**: Agreeing on transaction order
4. **Data Availability**: Making transaction data public

Modular blockchains distribute these functions across specialized chains. For example:

- **Optimistic Rollups** (Optimism, Arbitrum) - Execute off-chain, post compressed data & fraud proofs to Ethereum
- **ZK Rollups** (zkSync, StarkNet) - Execute off-chain, post compressed data & validity proofs to Ethereum
- **Validiums** (Immutable X) - Execute and store data off-chain, post only validations to Ethereum
- **Data Availability Layers** (Celestia) - Focus solely on ensuring data is published
- **Settlement Layers** (Ethereum) - Focus on security and finality of transactions

This specialization enables better performance, lower fees, and greater optionality.

## 📊 Different L2s, Different Analytics

Each L2 has its own data structure, which shapes how you analyze it:

### 🔵 Optimistic Rollups

- Bundles of transactions are posted to Ethereum
- 7-day challenge period before finality
- Data lives on Ethereum (good for analytics)

### 🟣 ZK Rollups

- Transaction validity proven cryptographically
- Immediate finality once proven
- Data compression can make analytics challenging
- Proof generation is computationally intensive

### 🟠 Sidechains

- Independent chains with their own consensus
- Bridge to Ethereum for asset transfers
- Not technically L2s, but often grouped with them
- Separate data layer (requires separate indexing)

## 🔍 Key Metrics to Track Across Chains

When analyzing modular blockchain ecosystems, focus on:

### 1. Bridge Activity

- **Value locked**: How much is secured by bridges
- **Inflows/outflows**: Net capital movement direction
- **Bridge usage**: Unique users, transaction count
- **Bridge costs**: Fees compared to on-chain activity

```sql
sql

-- Bridge outflows to L2s
SELECT 
  destination_chain,
  SUM(amount_usd) AS bridged_out_usd
FROM bridges.flows
WHERE source_chain = 'ethereum'
AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### 2. Transaction & Fee Comparisons

- **Transaction volume**: Which chains have most activity
- **Fee comparisons**: Cost per tx on each chain
- **Gas usage**: How much computation is happening

```sql
sql

-- Gas price by chain
SELECT 
  blockchain,
  AVG(gas_price * gas_used / 1e9) AS avg_fee_gwei,
  AVG(tx_fee_usd) AS avg_fee_usd
FROM transactions
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
```

### 3. TVL (Total Value Locked)

- **Value secured**: Assets on each chain
- **Token distribution**: Native vs bridged assets
- **Protocol dominance**: Which dApps have most TVL

### 4. User Migration

- **Cross-chain users**: Wallets active on multiple chains
- **Migration patterns**: First chain used vs current usage
- **Retention**: Users who stay vs one-time users

## 🧪 Multichain Dashboard Strategies

When building multichain dashboards:

- Use **standardized measures** (USD values, not native tokens)
- Create **cross-chain identifiers** for users and protocols
- Add **chain filters** to let viewers compare specific chains
- Include **gas-adjusted metrics** to account for differing costs
- Develop **bridge flow visualizations** to track movement

------

## 🧩 Technical Considerations

For onchain analysts, multichain analytics presents challenges:

- **Different data structures**: Each chain organizes data differently
- **Varying finality times**: Some chains finalize in 12 seconds, others in 7 days
- **Address formats**: Some use 0x, others use different formats
- **Reorgs and rollbacks**: L2s can have different reorg risks
- **Entity resolution**: Same user/protocol appearing on different chains

## 🔮 The Multi-Chain Future

As a blockchain analyst, your future involves tracking not just one chain, but whole ecosystems of interlinked networks.

The most valuable analytics will help users and protocols navigate this complexity:

- Which chain should I deploy on?
- Where are users moving?
- How are assets flowing between systems?
- Where are new projects launching first?

This isn't just technical—it's about understanding market behavior in a fragmented landscape.
