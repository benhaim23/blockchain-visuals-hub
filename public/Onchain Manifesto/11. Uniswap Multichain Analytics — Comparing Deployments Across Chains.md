# 11. Uniswap Multichain Analytics â€” Comparing Deployments Across Chains

Uniswap started on Ethereum, but it didnâ€™t stay there.

Today, the protocol is deployed across multiple EVM chainsâ€”Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, BNB Chain, and more. Each chain has different users, liquidity conditions, gas costs, and activity levels.

As an onchain analyst, comparing these deployments side by side is a powerful exercise. It tells us where growth is happening, where liquidity is sticky, and how Uniswap adapts to each ecosystem.

In this article, weâ€™ll show how to do cross-chain Uniswap analysis using Dune.

## ðŸ¤¯ Why Multichain Matters

- Users are no longer Ethereum-only
- L2s and alt-L1s offer faster, cheaper trading
- Uniswap is the canonical DEX, but behavior varies by chain

You need to ask:

- Where is volume concentrated?
- Which chains attract the most LPs?
- How do fee revenues compare?
- Are the same wallets active across deployments?

Answering these questions makes you a stronger DeFi analyst.

## ðŸ“Š Comparing Volume Across Chains

Dune Spellbook provides **standardized tables** across chains. For Uniswap V3, you can use:

```sql
sql

spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps
```

This table combines swaps from all supported chains into one schema with a `blockchain` field.

### Example: Daily Volume per Chain

```sql
sql

SELECT 
  blockchain,
  DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(amount_usd) AS daily_volume
FROM spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps
WHERE block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2, 1
```

Visualize this as a line chart grouped by `blockchain`.

ðŸ“ˆ Youâ€™ll quickly see trendsâ€”who's growing, whoâ€™s stagnating.

## ðŸ’¸ LP Fee Revenue by Chain

Want to see where LPs are earning the most?

Just query the `fee_amount_usd` field:

```sql
sql

SELECT 
  blockchain,
  SUM(fee_amount_usd) AS total_fees
FROM spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps
WHERE block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_fees DESC
```

You may be surprisedâ€”some chains punch above their weight.

## ðŸ§  Analyzing User Behavior

Do wallets act the same across chains?

Use:

```sql
sql

SELECT 
  blockchain,
  COUNT(DISTINCT sender) AS unique_swappers
FROM spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps
WHERE block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY unique_swappers DESC
```

Or track individual wallets:

```sql
sql

SELECT 
  sender,
  COUNT(DISTINCT blockchain) AS chains_active
FROM spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps
GROUP BY 1
HAVING chains_active > 1
```

This shows cross-chain Uniswap power users.

## ðŸ§° Dashboard Design Ideas

Hereâ€™s what you can include in a multichain Uniswap dashboard:

- Daily volume by chain
- Fee revenue per chain
- LP wallet overlap across chains
- Top pairs per chain
- Average trade size comparison
- TVL (using `uniswap_v3.pool_day_data`)
- Protocol revenue (e.g. 0.05% of fees if fee switch is on)

Bonus: Add dropdown filters by chain, pair, or token.

------

## ðŸ§± Infrastructure Tips

Use these tables from Spellbook:

- `spellbook.uniswap_v3.swaps`
- `spellbook.uniswap_v3.pool_day_data`
- `spellbook.uniswap_v3.liquidity_positions`
- `prices.usd` (for USD conversions)

Remember:

âœ… Always filter by `block_time`
 âœ… Use `blockchain` in the GROUP BY
 âœ… Join with price tables when needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters

Multichain analytics is no longer optional.

Uniswapâ€™s future (and most protocolsâ€™) is cross-chain:

- LPs chase yield across ecosystems
- Protocols deploy governance experiments by chain
- Users follow gas fees, incentives, and latency

Understanding these differences lets you:

- Advise protocols on deployment strategies
- Surface which chains drive core usage
- Detect liquidity fragmentation risks
- Compare user retention across environments

Itâ€™s not just about volumeâ€”itâ€™s about context.

## ðŸš€ Final Thought

Uniswap multichain analytics puts your SQL to the testâ€”but the insights are worth it.

When you can analyze a protocol across 6+ ecosystems and surface trends in volume, usage, and earningsâ€”youâ€™ve crossed the line from dashboard builder to full-stack DeFi analyst.
