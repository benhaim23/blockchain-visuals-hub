> "You don't need to run a node. You just need a query."

At first glance, blockchains seem like a mess of cryptographic hashes and pseudonymous wallets. But behind the complexity lies one of the most powerful features of this technology: every action is stored on a public ledger—and you can query it.

That's where **Dune** comes in.

Dune is a powerful analytics platform that transforms the firehose of raw blockchain data into a structured, queryable database. It's where data analysts, protocol teams, and community sleuths go to build dashboards, monitor behavior, and uncover what's really happening onchain.

Let's get you oriented.

## Why Dune?

Think of Dune as the **SQL-powered Google for blockchain activity**. It sits on top of the raw data from EVM chains and lets you query, join, visualize, and share insights—without needing to set up a node, parse hex logs, or manage infrastructure.

### 🔍 Key Benefits

- **Instant access to decoded data** across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and others  
- **No need to run a node or process logs manually**
- **Custom SQL queries** with live results
- **Powerful dashboards** that update automatically
- **Community-driven Spellbook** for reusable query logic
- **Free-tier access to build and publish**

---

## Navigating the Interface

When you open [dune.com](https://dune.com), you'll find:

### 🧾 **Queries**

This is where the magic happens. Every query is a SQL script that pulls from decoded blockchain tables.

- Use the **query editor** to write and run SQL
- Visualize results with tables, charts, or graphs
- Save your queries, fork others, or share links publicly

### 📊 **Dashboards**

Dashboards are collections of queries with visualizations. They let you tell a story with data.

- Track metrics over time (TVL, swap volume, active users)
- Combine multiple chains or protocols in one place
- Embed charts in blog posts, docs, or Notion pages

### 📚 **Table Explorer**

Explore the underlying schema.

- Filter by blockchain (e.g. \`ethereum\`, \`arbitrum\`, \`bitcoin\`)
- Browse by category: \`transactions\`, \`token_transfers\`, \`logs\`, etc.
- View column definitions and data samples

### 🧙‍♀️ **Spellbook**

A collection of curated, reusable models written by the Dune community and maintained in the open-source Spellbook repo.

- Abstracts complex logic into reusable tables
- Contributes to standardization of metrics across dashboards

## Core Tables You'll Use Often

| Table                      | Description                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| \`ethereum.transactions\`    | All Ethereum L1 transactions                           |
| \`ethereum.token_transfers\` | ERC-20 transfer events                                 |
| \`ethereum.logs\`            | Raw event logs from contracts                          |
| \`ethereum.traces\`          | Internal transactions (e.g. from smart contract calls) |
| \`prices.usd\`               | Historical token prices by minute                      |
| \`erc20.events\`             | Decoded logs for token transfers, approvals, etc.      |
| \`erc721.events\`            | NFT mints, transfers, sales, and metadata              |
| \`uniswap_v3.swaps\`         | Detailed DEX activity for Uniswap v3                   |
| \`compound.liquidations\`    | Liquidation activity in lending protocols              |

> These are the building blocks of DeFi, NFT, and wallet behavior analytics.

## Getting Started with a Query

Here's a simple example: count the daily number of Ethereum transactions over the past 30 days.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS tx_count
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

Click **Run**, and you'll see a time series of transaction counts. Add a line chart, give it a title, and you've just built your first visualization.

------

## Forking and Iterating

Dune is collaborative by design.

- Found a cool dashboard? **Fork it**, and customize it for your use case.
- Need a metric that doesn't exist? Build it, publish it, and help others.

Each query is a learning opportunity. Reading, editing, and reverse-engineering community dashboards is one of the fastest ways to learn.

------

## DuneSQL vs Legacy Engine

Dune is currently transitioning from the legacy engine to **DuneSQL**, a modular and more scalable engine based on **Databricks** and **dbt**.

We'll explore this in-depth later, but know that:

- **DuneSQL** uses a separate editor and schema
- **Spellbook models** are written for DuneSQL only
- Long-term support and future features will prioritize DuneSQL

> If you're just getting started, build in DuneSQL.

------

## Best Practices

- **Use \`date_trunc\`** to group time series cleanly
- **Add \`WHERE block_time >\`** to filter large tables
- **Join with \`prices.usd\`** for consistent USD metrics
- **Document your queries**—future you (and others) will thank you
- **Use \`limit\` when exploring** new tables to avoid timeouts

------

## What You Can Build

- 🏦 DAO treasury trackers
- 📈 DEX volume and LP revenue dashboards
- 🎨 NFT minting + secondary market trend boards
- 🧠 MEV activity heatmaps
- 🔎 Whales and wallet label explorers
- 🧱 Protocol-specific analytics: Compound, Aave, Lido, etc.

You're limited only by your creativity—and your understanding of the underlying data.

## Ready to Query the Chain?

The Dune platform gives you a real-time lens into the most transparent data system ever created. It's free, powerful, and open.

But like any tool, it's only as good as the person using it.

In the next article, we'll dig deeper into the structure of blockchain tables—how to read them, understand them, and link them together to tell meaningful stories.
