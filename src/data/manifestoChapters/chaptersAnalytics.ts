    mdContent: `# 04. Understanding Tables — Ethereum, Bitcoin, NFTs, ERC4337, and More

If the blockchain is the raw ledger, and Dune is the window into it—then tables are the DNA of onchain analytics.

To do real work as an onchain data analyst, you need to know how blockchain data is structured, how Dune organizes it, and how to query the right fields.

This article walks through the anatomy of blockchain tables—covering Ethereum, Bitcoin, ERC4337 (Account Abstraction), NFTs, and more.

---

## The EVM Data Model

Most blockchains supported by Dune are **EVM-compatible** (Ethereum Virtual Machine), meaning they use the same account-based structure:

- **EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts):** wallets controlled by private keys  
- **Contract Accounts:** smart contracts that execute code when called  

Every action on an EVM chain emits:

- A **transaction**
- One or more **events** (emitted from smart contracts)
- Changes to **state** (tracked via internal calls)

Dune decodes all of these into readable tables.

---

## Core Ethereum Tables

Here are the most essential tables you'll use on Ethereum and other EVM chains:

### \`ethereum.transactions\`

Every transaction sent on the network.

**Key fields:**

- \`hash\`: transaction hash  
- \`from\`, \`to\`: sender and recipient  
- \`value\`: ETH transferred  
- \`gas_used\`, \`gas_price\`: cost of execution  
- \`block_time\`: timestamp  

---

### \`ethereum.logs\`

Decoded event logs from smart contracts.

**Use this to capture things like:**

- Token transfers  
- NFT mints  
- DAO proposals  
- DEX swaps  

You'll often filter by \`event_name\` and \`contract_address\`.

---

### \`ethereum.token_transfers\`

Normalized view of ERC20 transfers (built from \`logs\`).

**Key fields:**

- \`token_address\`: contract address of the token  
- \`from\`, \`to\`: sender and receiver  
- \`amount\`: token amount  
- \`block_time\`: when it happened  

This is useful for tracking token flow, whale movements, or airdrops.

---

### \`prices.usd\`

Maps token prices over time for consistent USD calculations.

**Join on:**  
- \`contract_address\`  
- \`minute\` (rounded timestamp)  

---

## NFT Tables

For NFTs, Dune often decodes each major collection or marketplace into its own schema.

Look for schemas like:

- \`seaport_ethereum\` (OpenSea)  
- \`blur_ethereum\`  
- \`nft_ethereum\`  
- \`erc721_transfers\`  

Track:

- \`minted\`, \`sold\`, \`transferred\`, \`burned\`
- Price, buyer, seller, royalty fees

---

## Bitcoin Tables: UTXO Model

Unlike Ethereum's account model, Bitcoin uses a **UTXO** (Unspent Transaction Output) model.

That means there is no "account balance." Instead, wallets hold a collection of unspent outputs.

Dune provides:

### \`bitcoin.inputs\`

Each input spent in a BTC transaction.

**Fields:**

- \`address\`: the spender  
- \`value\`: amount of BTC  
- \`block_time\`: when the transaction occurred  

---

### \`bitcoin.outputs\`

Each output generated in a BTC transaction.

**Fields:**

- \`address\`: the receiver  
- \`value\`: BTC received  
- \`block_time\`: timestamp  

Together, these two tables allow analysis of HODLing behavior, coin lifespan, and metrics like **Coin Days Destroyed (CDD)**.

---

## ERC-4337 Tables (Account Abstraction)

ERC-4337 introduces a new way of transacting using smart contract wallets.

Dune decodes these contracts into a special schema—\`erc4337\`.

### \`erc4337_<chain>.EntryPoint_v0_6_evt_UserOperationEvent\`

Each user operation submitted via a smart wallet.

**Fields to know:**

- \`sender\`: the smart wallet  
- \`paymaster\`: who paid gas  
- \`actualGasCost\`: gas used  
- \`success\`: if the operation succeeded  

Also explore:

- \`AccountDeployed\` events  
- \`handleOps()\` calls  
- \`EntryPoint\` contract interactions  

---

## Aggregated Spellbook Tables

Dune's community-built **Spellbook** offers aggregated, cleaned-up models across chains.

Instead of querying 9 versions of a table, use:

- \`account_abstraction_erc4337.userops\`: unified ERC-4337 activity  
- \`uniswap_v3.uniswap_v3_swaps\`: all Uniswap V3 swaps across chains  
- \`nft.trades\`: normalized NFT sales data  

We'll explore Spellbook more later—just know these **save time** and **boost consistency**.

---

## Best Practices

- Always filter by \`block_time >\` to avoid scanning full history  
- Use \`date_trunc('day', timestamp)\` to group time series  
- Join with \`prices.usd\` to convert token amounts to USD  
- Use \`LIMIT\` when exploring new tables  
- Use \`LOWER()\` to normalize addresses when joining  
- Explore schema docs in the left-hand panel of Dune's editor  

---

## Where to Find Table Names

In the Dune query editor:

- Look to the left sidebar  
- Browse by chain → schema → table  
- Click a table to preview fields and structure  

Or type \`/ethereum.\` to trigger autocomplete.

---

## You Are What You Query

Every meaningful dashboard starts with understanding the structure beneath it.

In Web2, this might mean knowing the difference between GA4 and Mixpanel.

In Web3, it means understanding tables like:

- \`ethereum.transactions\`  
- \`erc20.token_transfers\`  
- \`bitcoin.outputs\`  
- \`erc4337.UserOperationEvent\`  
- \`spellbook.models.uniswap_v3_swaps\`  

Once you master the table structure, the data opens up.

    pdfPath: "/Onchain Manifesto/05. SQL Basics for Blockchain Analytics.pdf",
    mdContent: `# 05. SQL Basics for Blockchain Analytics

To unlock insights from onchain data, you need one essential tool: **SQL**.

It's the language that lets you ask questions like:

- "How many users swapped on Uniswap last week?"
- "Which wallets minted the most NFTs yesterday?"
- "What's the average gas fee per transaction over time?"
- "How much revenue did this protocol generate in the last 30 days?"

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the backbone of every great onchain dashboard—and you don't need to be a software engineer to learn it.

This guide will help you speak fluent SQL in the blockchain context.

---

## SQL on Dune: A Quick Refresher

Dune uses **PostgreSQL-style syntax** with some extensions for time and math functions.

Queries are typically structured like this:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table_name
WHERE conditions
GROUP BY column_1
ORDER BY column_1
\`\`\`

Let's look at each part in the context of onchain data.

------

## SELECT: Choose What You Want

Use \`SELECT\` to define the columns you want to display.

Example:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  block_time, 
  from_address, 
  to_address, 
  value
FROM ethereum.transactions
\`\`\`

You can also use functions inside \`SELECT\`, such as:

- \`COUNT(*)\` – total rows
- \`SUM(value)\` – total value transferred
- \`AVG(gas_price)\` – average gas fee

------

## WHERE: Filter the Data

You don't want all of history—just what matters.

\`\`\`sql
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
\`\`\`

Other common conditions:

\`\`\`sql
WHERE value > 0
WHERE from = LOWER('0xabc123...')
WHERE contract_address = '0xUniswapV3Pool'
\`\`\`

✅ Use \`LOWER()\` to normalize addresses when joining or filtering.

------

## GROUP BY: Aggregate the Results

Use \`GROUP BY\` when you want to summarize data.

Example: count swaps per day:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS swap_count
FROM uniswap_v3.uniswap_v3_swaps
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

💡 \`date_trunc()\` is your best friend for time series.

------

## JOIN: Combine Tables

Join lets you merge data from different tables—for example, adding USD prices:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  t.block_time,
  t.token_address,
  t.amount / 1e18 AS token_amount,
  p.price,
  (t.amount / 1e18) * p.price AS amount_usd
FROM erc20.token_transfers t
LEFT JOIN prices.usd p
  ON t.token_address = p.contract_address
  AND date_trunc('minute', t.block_time) = p.minute
WHERE t.block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
\`\`\`

🧠 Always match on both \`token_address\` and \`minute\` for price joins.

------

## CASE: Create Custom Categories

Conditional logic with \`CASE\` lets you label rows:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT
  CASE 
    WHEN amount > 1000 THEN 'whale'
    WHEN amount > 100 THEN 'mid-tier'
    ELSE 'small'
  END AS size_category,
  COUNT(*) AS tx_count
FROM erc20.token_transfers
GROUP BY 1
\`\`\`

------

## Common Functions in Blockchain Analytics

- \`COUNT(*)\`: number of rows (events, transactions)
- \`SUM(column)\`: total tokens transferred or gas used
- \`AVG(column)\`: average gas fee, average swap size
- \`MAX/MIN\`: largest NFT sale, smallest transfer
- \`RANK()/ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)\`: leaderboard logic
- \`date_trunc('day', timestamp)\`: daily grouping

------

## Template Queries to Get You Started

**Daily transaction count:**

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS txs
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

**Top NFT minters (past 7 days):**

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  minter, 
  COUNT(*) AS mints
FROM nft_ethereum.mints
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10
\`\`\`

**Uniswap revenue in USD (last 30 days):**

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(fee_amount_usd) AS daily_revenue
FROM uniswap_v3.fees
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

------

## Mistakes to Avoid

🚫 Querying full tables without a time filter → always use \`WHERE block_time >\`

🚫 Joining price data without \`date_trunc('minute')\` → you'll miss matches

🚫 Comparing uppercase and lowercase addresses → use \`LOWER()\` consistently

🚫 Using \`SELECT *\` in big tables → only select the fields you need

------

## Why SQL Matters in Web3

SQL is the **lingua franca of data**—and onchain data is just a new domain.

If you can write clear, thoughtful queries, you can:

- Understand protocol health
- Monitor DAO treasuries
- Detect suspicious activity
- Track product usage
- Inform investment decisions

You're not just writing queries—you're building visibility in a transparent economy.

Once you're comfortable with SQL, the next step is mastering the right questions to ask.

Onchain data is rich—but messy. The best analysts learn to cut through the noise and surface signal. In this article, we'll share a collection of **useful query templates** for everyday analysis—whether you're building dashboards, writing reports, or just exploring.

Each example below includes the query goal, key tables, and a reusable SQL snippet.

---

## 🪙 Token Transfers

**Goal**: Track ERC20 transfers by volume or frequency.

**Table**: \`erc20.token_transfers\`

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS transfer_count,
  SUM(amount / 1e18) AS token_volume
FROM erc20.token_transfers
WHERE token_address = LOWER('0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48') -- USDC
  AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Use \`LOWER()\` for all token/wallet addresses to ensure case-insensitive matching.

------

## 🧼 NFT Wash Trading Detection

**Goal**: Spot suspicious NFT sales to self or known alt wallets.

**Table**: \`nft.trades\`

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  buyer,
  seller,
  COUNT(*) AS trades,
  SUM(price_usd) AS volume
FROM nft.trades
WHERE buyer = seller
  AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 4 DESC
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Filter trades where buyer = seller or use wallet clustering to flag sybil behavior.

------

## 🏦 DAO Treasury Monitoring

**Goal**: Track stablecoin inflows/outflows to a DAO-controlled multisig.

**Table**: \`erc20.token_transfers\`

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(CASE WHEN to_address = LOWER('0xDAOwallet') THEN amount / 1e6 ELSE 0 END) AS inflow,
  SUM(CASE WHEN from_address = LOWER('0xDAOwallet') THEN amount / 1e6 ELSE 0 END) AS outflow
FROM erc20.token_transfers
WHERE token_address = LOWER('0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7') -- USDT
  AND block_time > now() - interval '60 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

------

## 🧠 Whale Watching

**Goal**: Identify the top ERC20 recipients in the past week.

**Table**: \`erc20.token_transfers\`

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  to_address, 
  COUNT(*) AS tx_count,
  SUM(amount / 1e18) AS received_tokens
FROM erc20.token_transfers
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Use this with labels or merge with wallet tag datasets to identify CEXs, whales, or teams.

------

## 📈 DEX Swap Volume by Token

**Goal**: Analyze swap volume for a specific token on Uniswap V3.

**Table**: \`uniswap_v3.uniswap_v3_swaps\`

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(amount_usd) AS daily_volume
FROM uniswap_v3.uniswap_v3_swaps
WHERE (token_in = LOWER('0x...') OR token_out = LOWER('0x...')) -- Insert token
  AND block_time > now() - interval '14 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

------

## 💸 Protocol Fee Revenue

**Goal**: Measure revenue accrued by protocols with fee switches enabled.

**Table**: protocol-specific (e.g., \`uniswap_v3.fees\`, \`aave.liquidations\`, etc.)

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(fee_amount_usd) AS revenue
FROM uniswap_v3.fees
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Use \`prices.usd\` to normalize gas or token fees to USD for consistency.

------

## 🛠️ Cross-Chain Activity (Spellbook)

If you're using Spellbook models from DuneSQL, try this unified userop query:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  blockchain,
  COUNT(*) AS ops,
  SUM(op_fee_usd) AS total_fees
FROM account_abstraction_erc4337.userops
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '14 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
\`\`\`

------

## 📊 Dashboard Building Patterns

- Use \`date_trunc()\` for time series
- Normalize to USD when comparing tokens
- Always use \`LIMIT\` when exploring large tables
- Comment your code for future you (and others!)
- Combine queries with CTEs to keep logic clean

------

## 🧭 Where to Find More Queries

- Browse the [Dune Discover page](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards)
- Explore the [Spellbook GitHub repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook)
- Fork dashboards from top analysts (and reverse-engineer!)
- Join Telegram/Discord communities and ask questions

------

## Your Onchain Toolbox Grows

As you start saving useful queries, you'll build your own **playbook** of blockchain insights.

Eventually, you'll recognize patterns before writing code:

- Airdrop season? Check claim activity and sybil patterns.
- New NFT mint? Track mint velocity and secondary flips.
- Yield spike? Trace source of new liquidity and associated risk.

    mdContent: `# 07. NFT Analysis — Wash Trading, Mint Trends, and Market Health

NFTs are more than jpegs. They're programmable assets, social signals, financial instruments—and, occasionally, tools for manipulation.

As an onchain analyst, your job is to cut through the hype and uncover what's actually happening.

In this article, we'll explore how to analyze NFT ecosystems: track mint activity, spot wash trading, and measure collector behavior across marketplaces.

---

## 🧱 NFT Data Structure

NFT interactions primarily involve:

- **Minting** (creation of new tokens)
- **Transfers** (wallet-to-wallet moves)
- **Trades** (buy/sell on a marketplace)

On Dune, the main tables are:

- \`nft.mints\`
- \`nft.trades\`
- \`nft.transfers\`

These tables are normalized across chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) and marketplaces (OpenSea, Blur, LooksRare, etc.).

---

## 🎨 Analyzing Mint Trends

**Goal**: Understand how a new collection is being minted.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('hour', block_time) AS hour,
  COUNT(*) AS mints,
  COUNT(DISTINCT minter) AS unique_minters
FROM nft.mints
WHERE nft_contract_address = LOWER('0x...')
  AND block_time > now() - interval '3 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Early spikes in mints with low unique minters = possible botting.

You can also add a \`ROW_NUMBER()\` window to see **who minted the most**, or join with \`nft.transfers\` to see how quickly minted NFTs are flipped.

------

## 🔁 Spotting Wash Trading

Wash trading occurs when a user sells NFTs back and forth between wallets they control to simulate volume.

**Simple heuristic**: \`buyer = seller\` or sales between two wallets repeatedly.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  buyer,
  seller,
  COUNT(*) AS trades,
  SUM(price_usd) AS volume
FROM nft.trades
WHERE buyer = seller
  AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 4 DESC
\`\`\`

🧠 Advanced tip: Use clustering logic or wallet label datasets to catch repeat interactions across wallets.

------

## 💰 Marketplace Comparison

Want to know where volume is happening?

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  marketplace,
  COUNT(*) AS trades,
  SUM(price_usd) AS volume
FROM nft.trades
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
\`\`\`

This tells you who's dominating: Blur, OpenSea, X2Y2, etc.

You can go deeper by analyzing:

- Blur bid pool activity
- OpenSea royalties paid
- Unique wallets per platform

------

## 📊 Holder Behavior & Distribution

Use \`nft.transfers\` to build a simple holder distribution analysis:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  to_address,
  COUNT(*) AS holdings
FROM nft.transfers
WHERE nft_contract_address = LOWER('0x...')
  AND block_time <= now()
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 50
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Long-tail holders = healthier community. High concentration = whale risk.

To get **time-based snapshots** (e.g. holders at mint vs. now), you'll need to filter by block height or use snapshots from historical transfer state.

------

## 🧠 Common Questions NFT Analysts Ask

- Who minted the collection and how quickly?
- What's the average holding time before flipping?
- Are royalties being enforced (or bypassed)?
- Which whales are entering or exiting positions?
- Are there signs of inorganic volume or manipulation?

You can answer all of this with queries across \`nft.trades\`, \`nft.transfers\`, and \`nft.mints\`.

------

## 🧠 Mindset Shift

NFTs are not just art—they're behavioral data. Mint speed, holding duration, marketplace choice, wallet overlap—this is alpha.

Good NFT analysts aren't just collectors. They're pattern readers.

They detect sybils before the airdrop. They flag suspicious volume before a pump. They watch when big wallets exit.

**Next: 08. Lending Protocols — Risk, Liquidations, and User Behavior**`
  },
  { 
    number: 8, 
    title: "Lending Protocols — Risk, Liquidations, and User Behavior", 
    pdfPath: "/Onchain Manifesto/08. Lending Protocols — Risk, Liquidations, and User Behavior.pdf",
    mdContent: `# 08. Lending Protocols — Risk, Liquidations, and User Behavior

Lending protocols are the beating heart of DeFi. Billions in crypto assets are locked in platforms like Aave, Compound, and Morpho. Users borrow, lend, stake, and sometimes get liquidated—all onchain.

As an analyst, your job is to understand that flow: Where is risk accumulating? Who's overleveraged? What assets are being used as collateral, and how do positions evolve?

This article will walk through how to analyze lending markets using onchain data.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts in Onchain Lending

Before we query anything, let's review the key primitives:

- **Deposit**: User supplies an asset to earn interest.
- **Borrow**: User takes a loan against their collateral.
- **Repay**: Borrower pays back a loan.
- **Withdraw**: Lender takes back their supplied assets.
- **Liquidation**: A borrower's position is forcibly closed if it becomes too risky.

Each of these actions emits an onchain event and is captured in Dune tables like:

- \`aave_v2.ethereum.Borrow\`, \`Repay\`, \`Deposit\`, \`Withdraw\`, \`LiquidationCall\`
- \`compound_v2.ethereum.market_event_*\`
- \`morpho_*\` for peer-to-peer lending

---

## 💸 Tracking Borrowing Activity

Let's start simple: How much is being borrowed over time?

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', evt_block_time) AS day,
  SUM(amount / 1e18) AS borrowed_eth
FROM aave_v2_ethereum.Borrow
WHERE evt_block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

🧠 Tip: Always adjust for token decimals (1e18 is common for ETH-based tokens).

You can group by \`reserve\` to break it down by asset: WETH, USDC, DAI, etc.

------

## 🏦 Who Is Borrowing What?

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  borrower,
  reserve,
  COUNT(*) AS borrow_count,
  SUM(amount / 1e6) AS total_borrowed_usdc
FROM aave_v2_ethereum.Borrow
WHERE reserve = 'USDC'
  AND evt_block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 4 DESC
\`\`\`

Use this to identify whales, frequent borrowers, or degens looping stablecoins.

------

## 🔥 Liquidation Analysis

Liquidations are where risk turns into action. Who is getting liquidated—and for how much?

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', evt_block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS liquidation_count,
  SUM(liquidated_amount / 1e18) AS total_liquidated
FROM aave_v2_ethereum.LiquidationCall
WHERE evt_block_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

Want to see **top liquidated wallets**?

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  user,
  SUM(liquidated_amount / 1e18) AS total_liquidated
FROM aave_v2_ethereum.LiquidationCall
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20
\`\`\`

------

## 📉 Risk Monitoring

To analyze **at-risk positions**, you'll often want to join:

- Deposits
- Borrows
- Current token prices

Unfortunately, these aren't always stored as "position snapshots"—you must **reconstruct them** from event history or query protocols with onchain read functions (via APIs or decoded contracts).

🧠 Pro tip: Some dashboards or Dune Spellbook models pre-aggregate these views.

------

## 📊 Useful Metrics

| Metric                   | Why It Matters                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Borrow Utilization       | How much of supplied assets are currently borrowed |
| Collateral Ratio         | Used to identify at-risk positions                 |
| Liquidation Volume       | Proxy for market volatility or stress              |
| Borrowed Asset Breakdown | Stable vs volatile borrow demand                   |
| Borrower Distribution    | Whale-dominated vs retail-driven lending pool      |

------

## 🔍 Lending vs Protocol Types

| Protocol             | Model          | Notes                                           |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Lending data is a goldmine of behavioral and risk insight. You can track leverage entering or exiting the market, spot cascading liquidations during volatility, or monitor shifts in asset usage across time.

But lending protocols are complex. They have intricate state transitions, economic mechanisms, and edge cases.

So go slow. Read protocol docs. Look at event logs. Trace borrower lifecycles.

And always ask: **What story is the money telling?**

    mdContent: `# 09. DeFi Analysis — Liquidity, Incentives, and TVL Dynamics

DeFi unlocked a new paradigm: transparent financial infrastructure. Every swap, deposit, and liquidation happens in plain sight, leaving behind a trail of data.

As an onchain analyst, you're uniquely positioned to study what everyone else can only guess at: actual usage patterns, liquidity flows, and value capture in financial protocols.

This article explores how to analyze DeFi's core metrics, from TVL to incentive efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Understanding DeFi's Key Metrics

TVL (Total Value Locked) might be DeFi's most famous metric, but it's just the beginning.

Let's break down the key data points you'll track when analyzing a protocol:

### 🔒 TVL (Total Value Locked)

TVL measures how much value users have deposited into a protocol.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(amount_usd) AS tvl
FROM dex_protocol.deposits
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '90 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

But raw TVL is just a starting point. You need to ask:

- TVL per chain (bridged vs. native deposits)
- TVL by token (stablecoins vs. volatile assets)
- TVL per user tier (whales vs. retail deposits)

---

### 💧 Liquidity Depth

Liquidity isn't just about total deposits—it's about **where** and **how** that liquidity is deployed.

For AMMs like Uniswap, analyze:

- Tick distribution (for concentrated liquidity)
- Slippage for standard trade sizes
- Range efficiency (% time spent in active tick range)

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  pool,
  tick_lower,
  tick_upper,
  SUM(amount_usd) AS liquidity_usd,
  AVG(time_in_range_pct) AS efficiency
FROM uniswap_v3.positions
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
\`\`\`

---

### 📊 Volume vs. TVL Ratio

A high volume/TVL ratio indicates capital efficiency—how much trading volume a protocol generates per dollar of liquidity.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', day) AS day,
  trading_volume / tvl AS capital_efficiency
FROM (
  SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
    SUM(amount_usd) AS trading_volume 
  FROM dex.trades 
  GROUP BY 1
) t1
JOIN (
  SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
    AVG(tvl) AS tvl 
  FROM dex.tvl 
  GROUP BY 1
) t2 USING (day)
\`\`\`

---

### 🧪 Incentive Analysis

Many protocols incentivize TVL with token rewards. But are these incentives effective or wasteful?

Calculate the **cost per dollar of TVL**:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  SUM(incentive_amount_usd) / AVG(tvl) AS cost_per_dollar_tvl
FROM protocol.incentives
JOIN protocol.tvl USING (day)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

---

## 🔍 DeFi Anti-Patterns to Watch For

Healthy DeFi protocols show some common patterns:

- **Balanced user distribution** (not whale-dominated)
- **Sustainable yield curves** (not entirely from token emissions)
- **Rational TVL growth** (not purely incentive-chasing)

Here's how to spot potential issues:

### Whale Concentration

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT address) AS wallets,
  SUM(CASE WHEN balance_usd > 100000 THEN balance_usd ELSE 0 END) / SUM(balance_usd) AS whale_concentration
FROM protocol.balances
WHERE block_time = '2023-06-01'
\`\`\`

### TVL/Market Cap Ratio

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', day) AS day,
  TVL / token_marketcap AS tvl_mcap_ratio
FROM protocol_metrics
WHERE day > now() - interval '90 days'
\`\`\`

A TVL/MCAP ratio below 1 often indicates overvaluation or unsustainable incentives.

## 🧰 Building DeFi Dashboards in Dune

Effective DeFi dashboards should show:

1. **Protocol Totals**: TVL, unique users, protocol revenue
2. **User Segments**: Retail vs. whales, new vs. existing
3. **Incentive Analysis**: Reward distribution, cost of acquisition
4. **Comparative View**: Performance vs. competitors

Remember to include:

- **Daily, weekly, monthly trends**
- **USD normalization** for all token values
- **Divergence indicators** for correlated metrics

---

## 📚 Examples to Learn From

- Curve Gauge Voting Analytics
- Uniswap LP Profitability Dashboard
- Aave Liquidation Monitor
- Lido Staking Concentration Analysis

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

DeFi analytics gives you superpowers. While TradFi operates behind closed doors, DeFi exposes its inner workings.

This transparency enables you to spot opportunities and risks that would be completely hidden in traditional finance.

Whether you're analyzing a new yield farming protocol, tracking liquidity shifts across DEXs, or evaluating governance decisions—the data is there, waiting to be queried.

    mdContent: `# 10. MEV on Uniswap — Understanding and Quantifying Extracted Value

MEV—Maximal Extractable Value (formerly Miner Extractable Value)—is the invisible tax of the DeFi ecosystem. It represents the profit that can be extracted from users by controlling transaction ordering.

For analysts, MEV offers a fascinating window into market microstructure, efficiency, and the actual cost of trading in decentralized markets.

This article explores how to measure, track, and analyze MEV activity on Uniswap.

---

## 🧩 What Is MEV?

MEV occurs when a block producer or trader can profit by controlling transaction ordering. Common MEV strategies include:

- **Sandwich attacks**: Frontrunning and backrunning user trades
- **Arbitrage**: Profiting from price differences between pools
- **Liquidations**: Racing to liquidate undercollateralized positions
- **Just-in-time liquidity**: Adding and removing liquidity around large trades

While some MEV is natural market efficiency (like arbitrage), other forms directly extract value from users.

---

## 📊 Measuring Sandwich Attacks on Uniswap

Sandwich attacks are the most common form of MEV on Uniswap. Here's how to detect them:

\`\`\`sql
WITH swaps AS (
  SELECT
    tx_hash,
    block_number,
    index,
    sender,
    amount0_in,
    amount1_in,
    amount0_out,
    amount1_out,
    pool
  FROM uniswap_v3.swaps
  WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7 days'
)

SELECT
  victim.tx_hash AS victim_tx,
  frontrun.tx_hash AS frontrun_tx,
  backrun.tx_hash AS backrun_tx,
  (backrun.amount1_out - frontrun.amount1_in) AS profit_token1,
  (backrun.amount0_out - frontrun.amount0_in) AS profit_token0
FROM swaps victim
JOIN swaps frontrun ON 
  victim.block_number = frontrun.block_number AND
  victim.index > frontrun.index AND
  victim.pool = frontrun.pool
JOIN swaps backrun ON 
  victim.block_number = backrun.block_number AND
  victim.index < backrun.index AND
  victim.pool = backrun.pool
WHERE 
  frontrun.sender = backrun.sender AND
  victim.sender != frontrun.sender
\`\`\`

This query identifies patterns where the same address:
1. Makes a swap (frontrun)
2. Is followed by another user's transaction 
3. Makes another swap in the opposite direction (backrun)

---

## 📉 Quantifying User Value Extraction

How much are users losing to MEV? Here's a calculation:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS sandwiched_txs,
  COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT tx_hash) AS sandwich_rate,
  SUM(mev_extracted_usd) AS total_mev_usd
FROM mev.sandwiches
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

Key metrics to track:
- **Total MEV extracted** (in USD)
- **MEV as % of trading volume**
- **% of trades affected**
- **Average extraction per trade**

---

## 🧠 Advanced: Cross-chain MEV Comparison

Different chains have different block times, validator sets, and MEV markets. Compare MEV intensity:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  blockchain,
  COUNT(*) AS total_swaps,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN is_sandwiched THEN tx_hash END) AS sandwiched_swaps,
  AVG(CASE WHEN is_sandwiched THEN price_impact_pct ELSE NULL END) AS avg_sandwich_impact,
  SUM(CASE WHEN is_sandwiched THEN mev_extracted_usd ELSE 0 END) / SUM(volume_usd) AS mev_tax_rate
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '14 days'
  AND project = 'uniswap'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 5 DESC
\`\`\`

Insights to surface:
- Ethereum vs. L2s MEV rates
- Impact of different sequencers/validators
- Effectiveness of MEV protection mechanisms

---

## 📋 MEV Mitigation and Dashboards

MEV can be mitigated through:

- **MEV-Share and MEV-Boost**: More equitable distribution of MEV
- **Private RPC endpoints**: Like Flashbots Protect
- **Design improvements**: Like fair sequencing and timing games

Your MEV dashboard should include:

1. **MEV volume over time**
2. **% of trades affected**
3. **Top MEV extractors** (addresses)
4. **Pool-specific MEV activity**
5. **User cost analysis**

---

## 🧩 Beyond Sandwiches: Time-Based Analysis

MEV patterns often cluster around specific market conditions. Analyze:

- Block builder concentration
- Gas price spikes during MEV opportunities
- Correlation between volatility and MEV activity

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('hour', block_time) AS hour,
  COUNT(*) AS mev_txs,
  AVG(gas_price) AS avg_gas_price,
  SUM(mev_profit_usd) AS total_profit,
  AVG(token_price_volatility) AS avg_volatility
FROM mev.transactions
JOIN market_stats USING (hour)
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
\`\`\`

---

## 🧰 Technical Challenges in MEV Analysis

Accurate MEV analysis requires:

- **Transaction trace data** (not just successful swaps)
- **Gas price and fee analysis**
- **Pool reserves at specific blocks**
- **Knowledge of MEV-specific patterns**

---

## 🔮 The Future of MEV Analytics

As MEV evolves, analysts will need to track:

- **Cross-domain MEV** (spanning multiple DEXs or chains)
- **L2-specific extraction patterns**
- **Regulatory and economic impacts**
- **Builder and searcher competition dynamics**

---

## 🧠 Conclusion: Why MEV Matters

MEV is a direct window into blockchain market efficiency. By quantifying it, you can:

- Evaluate the actual cost of trading on different protocols
- Assess builder and validator competition
- Measure the effectiveness of MEV mitigation strategies
- Understand the true economics of DeFi

For onchain analysts, MEV represents one of the most technically fascinating areas of study—where game theory, market microstructure, and blockchain mechanics intersect.
